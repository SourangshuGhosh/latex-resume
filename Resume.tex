\heading{Interests}

My broad area of interest is machine learning. I am currently working on deep learning,
particularly on generative models including GANs and Variational Autoencoders.
In the future I want to work in more mathematically involved areas including statistical
machine learning, optimization, algorithms, and learning theory.

\textbf{Bachelor's Thesis, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur} \hfill 2015 - 2016\\
\textbf{Visualization Regularizers for Neural Network based Image Recognition}\\
Advisor: Prof. Pabitra Mitra

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
    Introduced a novel regularizer for Neural Networks
    based on the \emph{visualizations} of the hidden nodes. 
    We leveraged the closed algebraic form of the
    visualizations of the first layer nodes, and used it as a smoothness prior.
    We show that the regularizer is a special case of the 
    general Tikhonov regularization. Experimental results show that the 
    visualization regularizers are an improvement over standard L2 regularizers.

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  On AdaBoost in a multiview setting.
  Introduced a notion of ‘difficulty’ of an example. Difficulty ranges 
  from -1 to 1 and is a linear function of the number of views the example
  was misclassified in. The weights are updated as a function of the 
  difficulty the example rather than on whether the example was misclassified
  or not. We show that this is an improvement over other multiview frameworks. Analogous
  to AdaBoost, we derived bounds on 
  the empirical risk and maximum margin.

\textbf{Natural Language Inference (NLI) using Deep Learning for NLP}\\
with Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Worked with the Stanford NLI dataset. Given two sentences, the task
  is to determine whether the sentences are related as an entailment, contradiction
  or neutral. We explored models using LSTMs, Attentions, and Dependency Parses,
  and finally came up with a hybrid model. This work
  has been submitted to a reputed conference.

\textbf{Feature Learning in Clinical Time Series using Deep Learning}\\
with Prof. Yan Liu

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Worked with ICU time series data consisting and used deep learning with a laplacian 
  prior regularizer to predict health outcomes. We performed causality analysis on the 
  final layer nodes, analyzed the activations of the most \emph{causal} nodes 
  using decision trees, and extracted their maximally activating inputs. This analysis
  is a step towards understanding neural networks in the context of medical data.

\textbf{On Farey Table and its Compression for Space Optimization with Guaranteed Error Bounds}\\
with Prof. Partha Bhowmick

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Studied the number theoretic properties of Farey Sequences and the
  Farey Table, and came up with a novel algorithm for a lossy compression of the 
  Farey Table. The Farey Table is an useful data-structure in digital geometry.
  It's quadratic size ($\Theta(n^2)$) prohibits its use for large dimensions. The
  compressed table has a size of ($O(n\log n)$), thus allowing table creation for
  larger $n$.
